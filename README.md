# KRISHI BOT 🍅🤖
## Project Description📝
The Agriculture Automation Robot is a sophisticated system designed to revolutionize greenhouse farming. Equipped with a six-axis manipulator and a depth camera, this robot autonomously navigates within the greenhouse environment, identifies ripe tomatoes using its depth camera, and harvests them with precision. Once harvested, the tomatoes are gently placed into a designated basket for collection.

## Features 🪄
-   **Autonomous Navigation**: Utilizing advanced navigation algorithms, the robot moves seamlessly within the greenhouse, avoiding obstacles and efficiently covering the entire area.
-   **Depth Camera Tomato Detection**: The depth camera allows the robot to accurately detect and identify ripe tomatoes based on their size, shape, and depth information.
-   **Robotic Arm Manipulation**: With its six-axis manipulator, the robot carefully approaches the identified tomatoes, plucks them from the vine, and places them into the collection basket.
-   **Efficient Harvesting**: By automating the harvesting process, the robot increases efficiency and reduces labor costs, ensuring a timely and consistent supply of fresh produce.
